SimpleEclipseViewer ![Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/Treehopper/SimpleEclipseViewer.png?branch=master "Build Status")
===================

JFaces TreeViewer, TableViewer and TreeTable are powerful controls, but for creating a viewer with advanced features such as:
- incremental pattern filter with highlighting,
- drag and drop with auto-expand, etc. or
- icon decoration

the API makes you jump through hoops. Especially if you want to use such features in combination.
SimpleEclipseViewer tries to fix this.
